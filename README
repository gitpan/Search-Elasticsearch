ElasticSearch.pm is a Perl API to ElasticSearch:

ElasticSearch is an Open Source (Apache 2 license), distributed, RESTful
Search Engine based on Lucene, and built for the cloud, with a JSON API.

Check out its features: L<http://www.elasticsearch.com/products/elasticsearch/>

This module is a thin API which makes it easy to communicate with an
ElasticSearch cluster.

It maintains a list of all servers/nodes in the ElasticSearch cluster, and
spreads the load randomly across these nodes.  If the current active node
disappears, then it attempts to connect to another node in the list.

Forking a process triggers a server list refresh, and a new connection to
a randomly chosen node in the list.
