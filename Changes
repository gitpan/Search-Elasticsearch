      - The test suite now requires Alien::ElasticSearch, and uses its own
        config file and work dir, so as not to interfere with existing
        data
      - Added clear_cache()
      - Added fuzzy_like_this and fuzzy_like_this_field clauses to
        count() and delete_by_query()
      - Added more_like_this()
      - Added more_like_this/more_like_this_field clauses to count()
        and delete_by_query()
      - Changed exclude_from and exclude_to to from_inclusive and to_inclusive
        in the terms() query
      - the filteredQuery clause renamed to 'filtered' as per a change in ES
      - Added aliases() and get_aliases()
      - Deleted the QueryDSL doc, as the ElasticSearch docs are much improved

      - Fixed the test suite so that auto-started nodes don't take over
        the terminal
      - Enabled more tests as ElasticSearch now less buggy
