1.14    2014-07-24
        Added support for indexed scripts and indexed templates.

1.13    2014-06-13
        Breaking change:
            The Scroll helper used to pass the scroll ID to
            scroll() and clear_scroll() in the query string by default,
            with the scroll_in_body parameter to change the behaviour.
            This was causing frequent errors with long scroll IDs, so
            the new default behaviour is to pass the scroll ID in the
            body, with the scroll_in_qs parameter to change that
            behaviour.
        All Search::Elasticsearch HTTP backends are now fork safe.
        Added track_scores param to search()
        Added create param to indices.put_template()
        Removed index_templates param from cluster.state()
        Removed indices_boost param from search()
        Added percolate_format param to percolate()
        Added cat.fielddata()

        Added search_shards()
        Added char_filters to indices.analyze()
        Removed index_templates from cluster.state()
        Added conf to TestServer for passing arbitrary config

1.11    2014-04-23
        Switched default Serializer::JSON to use JSON::MaybeXS, and added
        Serializer backends for Cpanel::JSON::XS, JSON::XS and JSON::PP

1.04    2014-02-27

        body. Better support for older versions and servers behind caching
        proxies.

        API updated to be compatible with v1.x branch of Elasticsearch.

        BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY: To use this client with versions of
        Elasticsearch before 1.x, specify the client version as:

            $es = Elasticsearch->new(
                client => '0_90::Direct'
            );

        Die with explanation if a user on a case-insensitive file system
        loads this module instead of ElasticSearch

        Added Elasticsearch::Bulk and Elasticsearch::Scroll
        Changed `https` to `use_https` for compatibility with elasticsearch-py
        Numerous fixes for different Perl versions, and Moo 1.003 now required
