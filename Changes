Revision history for ElasticSearch
0.44    2011-08-27
        Added support for deflate() to all HTTP Transport modules.

0.43    2011-08-26
        Added ElasticSearch::Transport::AECurl, and async backend which uses
        libcurl, via AnyEvent::Curl::Multi

0.42    2011-08-26
        Dull Dist::Zilla change, for CPAN

0.41    2011-08-26

        BREAKING CHANGES:
         - ElasticSearch::Transport::Thrift is now in a separate release
         - delete_index() and delete_mapping() now require an index
           parameter, to avoid accidental deletes.
         - the return value for the bulk() methods, when { as_json => 1}
           is specified, is now the JSON equivalent of the normal
           return value, not the raw value from ES

        OTHER:
         - started using Dist::Zilla
         - Added ElasticSearch::Transport::Curl, as a separate release
         - get_aliases now works with {as_json => 1}

0.40    2011-08-10

        BREAKING CHANGE:
         - index_exists now returns an empty list if the index doesn't exist.
           Previously, it threw an error.

        OTHER:
         - Deprecated the use of top level mapping parameters in put_mapping()
           in favour of just using the 'mapping' param
         - IDs could not contain eg "/" before - now fixed with Any::URI::Escape
           ie (URI::Escape or URI::Escape::XS)
         - The 'servers' param to new() now defaults to localhost if not
           specified
         - The "scroll" param to scrolled_search() now defaults to '1m'
         - added search_from and search_size to mlt()
         - added analyze_wildcard and lowercase_expanded_terms to searchqs()
         - mget() now returns [] if no docs specified, instead of dieing
         - Made Test::More v 0.96 a dependency, and fixed the hashbang path
           in the example (thanks to AVAR)

0.39    2011-07-19
         - "type" is now optional for get() requests
         - added index_exists()
         - added mget()
         - added SearchBuilder integration for aliases

0.38    2011-07-03
        - Integrated ElasticSearch::SearchBuilder
        - Deprecated the use of query types as top level params to count()
          and delete_by_query() in favour of query or queryb
        - trace_calls() now also accepts a filehandle (thanks FERREIRA)
        - TestServer now supports ES_TRANSPORT=all

0.37    2011-05-01

        BREAKING CHANGES:
         -  ElasticSearch::ScrolledSearch

            $scrolled_search->next() now returns 1 result by default, instead
            of $size results, to make it easier to write:

                while (my $result = $scroll->next) {}

         - ElasticSearch::TestServer is now an object which subclasses
           ElasticSearch itself.  connect_to_server() has been removed.
           Also, the port parameter can be used to specify a custom start port
           when starting the test server, making it easier to run the
           test server while there is an existing ES server running.

0.36    2011-04-24
        Updated ElasticSearch.pm to work with ElasticSearch version 0.16.0

        New features:
         - no_refresh:
           Disable the automatic discovery of live nodes, to work with
           remote clusters or proxied clusters

         - scrolled_search():
           Convenience iterator to wrap search/scroll requests

         - reindex():
           Utility to reindex data from one index to another, or one
           cluster to another

         - use_index()/use_type():
           Set default index/type parameters

         - searchqs():
           URI/query string search, (as opposed to search() which uses a
           request body)

         - New search_type's : 'scan' and 'count'

         - index_settings():
           Retrieve index settings

0.35    2011-04-07
        Added the 'dynamic_templates' option to put_mapping

0.34    2011-03-20

        Fixed the tests for scrolling - turns out sorting when scrolling works
        correctly. It was my tests which were bad.

0.33    2011-03-19
        Added the ElasticSearch::Transport::HTTPTiny backend

0.32    2011-03-19

         - Added as_json as an arg to all ES requests.
         - Fixed a logic bug when setting the port manually in
           ElasticSearch::TestServer
         - Fixed a bug in ElasticSearch::TestServer which was
           preventing it from working on OSX

         Thanks to PERLER for the above

          - Changed some query syntax in t/10-queryparser.t for perl 5.8.3

0.31    2011-03-16

        Fixed a bad test plan

0.30    2011-03-16

        - Added some missing requirements to Build.PL
        - scroll() now accepts a 'scroll' parameter and works (but
          sorting when scrolling still broken on the server)
        - reindex_es.pl now also preserves the _parent and _routing fields

0.29    2011-03-15
         - Updated the Changes file

               - delete_percolator()
               - get_percolator()
               - percolate()

         - Open / Close index
               - open_index()
               - close_index()

         - Index templates

         - Versioning
         - Analyzer
               - analyze()

         - ElasticSearch::QueryParser
               - Parses and filters query strings, to ensure that user
                 data is in an acceptable form for passing to ES

         - ElasticSearch::TestServer
               - starts a test server for use by the test suite
               - factored out to make it easier for others to use

        Also:
         - create_index() now supports adding mappings at the same time
         - Added bulk_create(), bulk_index() and bulk_delete()
         - Bulk actions now accept _id and id etc, which means that
           search results can be passed directly to bulk without renaming
           these parameters
         - Added river_status()
         - New errors
            - ElasticSearch::Error::Conflict - versioning conflict
            - ElasticSearch::Error::Missing - requested index/doct etc missing
            - both these errors inherit from ElasticSearch::Error::Request
         - Added ignore_missing to many methods which allows you to ignore
           Missing errors
         - Added query_parser
         - added timeout() as sugar for $es->transport->timeout()
         - added refresh_servers() as sugar for $es->transport->refresh_servers()

        In ElasticSearch::Transport
         - added max_requests() to force a refresh of known live nodes
           every $max_requests
         - on the first request, the list of live nodes is automatically
           updated
         - made httplite recognise more error states as temporary Connection
           errors
         - added support for recognising 404 and 409 HTTP codes
         - upgraded Thrift to version 5.0
         - improvements to logging

        Miscellaneous:

        Completely refactored ElasticSearch to enable pluggable backends:

        features of older versions.

      - In search() added support for 'script_fields'
      - In count() and delete_by_query() added support for 'custom_score',

      - Removed terms() - now handled by search facets

      - Changed put_mapping() to automatically prefix the type properties
        definition with the type name

        and 'filter_indices' params to cluster_state()



0.16    2010-05-20
        Added an ElasticSearch::Error::Timeout error class, to catch
        occassions when the request times out, instead of failing
        for a different reason.

        Also, catch 'Server closed connection' errors, and automatically
        refresh_servers and retry the request.

0.15    2010-05-16
        Fixed a bug in refresh_servers() introduced in 0.14, when forking
        processes.

0.14    2010-05-16
        The object now stores the original servers parameter, so that
        if the nodes disassociate and the live server list is limited,
        the object can still try the original servers.

0.13    2010-05-13
        Added nodes_stats(), shutdown(), restart() and camel_case()
        Removed Alien::ElasticSearch, as it is now easier to install
        ElasticSearch directly.
        Tested against ElasticSearch version 0.7.0

      - Updated the API to take into account ElasticSearch's change from
        using camelCase to underscore_separators

        default now is to complain

        been merged to boost_terms:float

0.06    2010-04-03

      - the filteredQuery clause renamed to 'filtered' as per a change in ES

      - Deleted the QueryDSL doc, as the ElasticSearch docs are much improved

        it refreshed the server list in new() )
      - Restructured the internals again, to make it easier to read
      - Added cluster_health()
      - Fixed the test suite so that auto-started nodes don't take over

      - Rewrote the module completely to use a dispatch table -
        makes it easier to extend
