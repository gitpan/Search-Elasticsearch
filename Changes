0.17    2010-08-01

        Supports ElasticSearch version 0.9, which removes support for some
        features of older versions.

      - In search() added support for 'script_fields'
      - In count() and delete_by_query() added support for 'custom_score',
        'fuzzy', 'span_term', 'span_first', 'span_near', 'span_not',
        'span_or'
      - Removed terms() - now handled by search facets
      - Added the 'full' parameter to flush_index()
      - Changed put_mapping() to automatically prefix the type properties
        definition with the type name
      - Removed get_mapping() and replaced it with mapping(), which uses
        the newly exposed GET _mapping API
      - Added current_server_version()
      - Added the 'filter_nodes', 'filter_metadata', 'filter_routing_table'
        and 'filter_indices' params to cluster_state()



0.16    2010-05-20
        Added an ElasticSearch::Error::Timeout error class, to catch
        occassions when the request times out, instead of failing
        for a different reason.

        Also, catch 'Server closed connection' errors, and automatically
        refresh_servers and retry the request.

0.15    2010-05-16
        Fixed a bug in refresh_servers() introduced in 0.14, when forking
        processes.

0.14    2010-05-16
        The object now stores the original servers parameter, so that
        if the nodes disassociate and the live server list is limited,
        the object can still try the original servers.

0.13    2010-05-13
        Added nodes_stats(), shutdown(), restart() and camel_case()
        Removed Alien::ElasticSearch, as it is now easier to install
        ElasticSearch directly.
        Tested against ElasticSearch version 0.7.0

0.12    2010-04-16
        Added scroll() and the indices_boost param to search()
        Tested against ElasticSearch version 0.6.0

        http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/commit/8cfa04cea3bc2317ee613384ced4da20cf2737aa

      - Updated the API to take into account ElasticSearch's change from
        using camelCase to underscore_separators
      - create() now uses the /_create postfix instead of op_type=create,
        although that flag is still available through index() and set()
      - Changed more_like_this and more_like_this_field to mlt and mlt_field
      - Changed fuzzy_like_this and fuzzy_like_this_field to flt and flt_field
      - Changed term() to use gt/gte/lt/lte instead of from/to and
        fromInclusive/toInclusive
      - put_mapping now defaults to { ignore_conflicts => 0 }, so the
        default now is to complain
      - In mlt, boost_terms:boolean and boost_terms_factor:float have now
        been merged to boost_terms:float

0.06    2010-04-03
      - The test suite now requires Alien::ElasticSearch, and uses its own
        config file and work dir, so as not to interfere with existing
        data
      - Added clear_cache()
      - Added fuzzy_like_this and fuzzy_like_this_field clauses to
        count() and delete_by_query()
      - Added more_like_this()
      - Added more_like_this/more_like_this_field clauses to count()
        and delete_by_query()
      - Changed exclude_from and exclude_to to from_inclusive and to_inclusive
        in the terms() query
      - the filteredQuery clause renamed to 'filtered' as per a change in ES
      - Added aliases() and get_aliases()
      - Deleted the QueryDSL doc, as the ElasticSearch docs are much improved

0.05    2010-03-04
      - Delayed connecting to the cluster until actually required (previously
        it refreshed the server list in new() )
      - Restructured the internals again, to make it easier to read
      - Added cluster_health()
      - Fixed the test suite so that auto-started nodes don't take over
        the terminal
      - Enabled more tests as ElasticSearch now less buggy

0.04    2010-02-23
      - Added terms()
      - Added get_mapping()
      - Renamed create_mapping() to put_mapping()
      - Added ignore_duplicate param to put_mapping
      - skip create-duplicate-mapping test if cluster has more than one nodes

0.03    2010-02-21
      - Corrected the docs for search/count/delete_by_query
      - Added POD for the Query DSL
      - Added a SIG{INT} to the test file, so that it shuts down the servers
        if the test suite is interrupted

0.02    2010-02-21
      - Rewrote the module completely to use a dispatch table -
        makes it easier to extend
      - Added a test suite
      - Added Alien::ElasticSearch so that we can test against a live server
